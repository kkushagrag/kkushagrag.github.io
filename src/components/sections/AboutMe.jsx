                I am a motivated full-stack developer and Java enthusiast,
                currently pursuing my third year of BTech in Computer Science
                Engineering. Originally from Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, I
                specialize in both frontend and backend technologies like
                React.js, Node.js, Java, and modern tools such as Next.js,
                TypeScript, and Socket.io. With a passion for leveraging
                technology to drive innovation and create exceptional user
                experiences, I aim to contribute to dynamic projects that push
                the boundaries of web development while maintaining a strong
                focus on user-centric design and performance.

                Since starting my web development journey a year ago, Iâ€™ve
                embraced new challenges, continuously learning and evolving with
                the latest technologies. I thrive in environments where I can
                take projects from ideation to deployment, ensuring every detail
                contributes to a high-quality product. Iâ€™m also open to
                freelance opportunities and collaborations, excited to connect
                with like-minded individuals and contribute to innovative
                projects.
